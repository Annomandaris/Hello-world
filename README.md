# Hello-world
First of many

It started with a drop,
nothing broken, nothing built
no triumphant moment.
It was, rather,
a quiet period,
dull with introspection,
where the spark first took.
Flames were not then beckoned,
nor did blaze leap forth.
Instead, a smouldering,
gentle but unrelenting
consumed from within.
